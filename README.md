# Tic-tac-toe
This is a command line version of Tic-tac-toe that can be played between two human players named Cross (X) and Nought (O).

To mark a desired square, player must input the number representing the square in the console when prompted. FAILURE to enter a number between 1 and 9 would result in a repeat prompt.

The squares are marked as follows:

            1 |2 |3
            --|--|--
            4 |5 |6
            --|--|--
            7 |8 |9
